# Backlog

- Support removal of dangling git locks
When repo-mirror/git crashes some dangling git locks
may be left around which will make further repo-mirror fail.
Would need to detect such condition and clean locks as they
are discovered. Ref to https://github.com/guillon/repo-mirror/issues/1

- Check possible race conditions with clean
Need to add tests for concurrent cleaning and mirror update.
This would check that cleaning implements correctly lock taking.
This test would also stress the events where objects are actually removed
from the alternate.
We suppose that objects removal/accesses is managed atomically
by git and thus that alternate repos can be read while being updated.
Need to find evidence of this in the documentation or git code
probably.

- Check possibility of --depth option for the mirror
As an optimization, the mirror could be cloned in shallow mode with
a --depth option.
Though the interaction with the local repo --depth is not clear.
Still a study until formal evidence that this can be implemented
correctly.
