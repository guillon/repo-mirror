- Check mirror when --prune is needed
Need to check behavior in case of git refs conflict that would need
pruning.
For instance if a git ref refs/heads/level1 is removed and then a
new git refs refs/heads/level1/level2 is created, the default
behavior of git is to fail unless git fetch --prune was explicitly
done.
When updating a mirror if this causes trouble to repo, we should
arrange to fix this, as the mirrors should not fail in such event
and silently prune the useless local references.

- Check possible race conditions with clean
Need to add tests for concurrent cleaning and mirror update.
This would check that cleaning implements correctly lock taking.
This test would also stress the events where objects are actually removed
from the alternate.
We suppose that objects removal/accesses is managed atomically
by git and thus that alternate repos can be read while being updated.
Need to find evidence of this in the documentation or git code
probably.

- Check possibility of --depth option for the mirror
As an optimization, the mirror could be cloned in shallow mode with
a --depth option.
Though the interaction with the local repo --depth is not clear.
Still a study until formal evidence that this can be implemented
correctly.
