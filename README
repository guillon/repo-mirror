The repo-mirror utility is a simple command for enabling automatic local
mirroring of repo git repositories.

The principle is to be able to replace the bare repo command by a repo-mirror
command that will handle the creation of the mirror repositories and
execute the actual repo command refering to the mirror repositories when
doing repo init/sync in particular.

For instance, in order to automatically benefit from a local shared mirror
for all the repositories of a repo manifest, instead of executing:

    $ repo init -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

on can execute:

    $ repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirrors -- init -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

Note that a visible effect on the repo init step is that the output
will show actually two repo init steps as it will first init/sync the mirror
and then init/sync the current dir.

The above two commands rougthly behaves as if one have typed:

    $ (cd $HOME/.repo-mirrors/... && repo init --mirror -u manifest_url.git)
    $ (cd $HOME/.repo-mirrors/... && repo sync)
    $ repo init --reference=$HOME/.repo-mirrors/... -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

Other things are actually done behind the scene such as selecting the
actual mirrors directory and taking locks where needed to.

# Examples

A typical usage of such a tool if for automatically setting up
local mirrors for build scripts.

For instance if the build script uses an envvar REPO (defaulting to repo)
before each repo commands once can simply set:

    $ REPO="repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirrors --"; export REPO
    $ ./build_script.sh

If one wants to make a repo command wrapper in case such envvar is not
available, it can be done this way:

    $ cat >repo <<EOF
    #!/bin/sh
    exec repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirrors -- ${1+"$@"}
    EOF
    $ PATH=$PWD:$PATH
    $ ./build_script.sh

Get the command line help with:

    $ repo-mirror --help
    Usage: repo-mirror [options] -- REPO_COMMAND...


# Build and Install

This tool requires python 2.6.x.

The tool can be used directly without installation by executing
directly repo-mirror where downloaded.

A makefile is provided anyway for completion and testing purpose.

Build with:

Run unittests with:

    $ make -j4 check

Install with, for instance:
