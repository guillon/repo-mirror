# Synopsis

The repo-mirror utility is a simple command for enabling automatic local
mirroring of repo git repositories.

The principle is to be able to replace the bare repo command by a repo-mirror
command that will handle the creation of the mirror repositories and
execute the actual repo command referring to the mirror repositories when
doing repo init/sync in particular.

For instance, in order to automatically benefit from a local shared mirror
for all the repositories of a repo manifest, instead of executing:

    $ repo init -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

one can execute:

    $ repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirror -- init -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

Note that a visible effect on the repo init step is that the output
will show actually two repo init steps as it will first init/sync the mirror
and then init/sync the current directory.

The above two commands roughly behave as if one has typed:

    $ (cd $HOME/.repo-mirror/... && repo init --mirror -u manifest_url.git)
    $ (cd $HOME/.repo-mirror/... && repo sync)
    $ repo init --reference=$HOME/.repo-mirror/... -u manifest_url.git
    $ repo sync

Other things are actually done behind the scene such as selecting the
actual mirrors directories, taking locks when needed and working
around limitations of git and repo regarding concurrency.


# Download

Download the repo-mirror tool from the releases page:
https://github.com/guillon/repo-mirror/releases

Or download the last stable version of the script from there:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/repo-mirror/master/repo-mirror

For instance:

    $ wget -O ~/bin/repo-mirror https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillon/repo-mirror/master/repo-mirror
    $ chmod +x ~/bin/repo-mirror


# Examples

A typical usage of such a tool is for automatically setting up
local mirrors for build scripts or, for a user, automatically
sharing git repositories between several concurrent repo directories.

For instance, if a build script uses an envvar REPO,
one can simply set it to:

    $ REPO="repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirror -j8 --"; export REPO
    $ ./build_script.sh

If one wants to make a repo command wrapper such that every invocation
of repo does automatically mirror repositories, it can be done this way:

    $ cat >$HOME/bin/repo <<EOF
    #!/bin/sh
    # Execute repo command under the control of repo-mirror.
    # Mirrors will be stored in $HOME/.repo-mirror as per -m option.
    # Note that the actual repo path must be given with the -r option.
    # Mirrors repo sync are done with 8 threads as per -j option.
    exec repo-mirror -m $HOME/.repo-mirror -r /usr/local/bin/repo -j8 -- ${1+"$@"}
    EOF
    $ chmod +x $HOME/bin/repo
    $ PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
    $ ./build_script.sh

Get the command line help with:

    $ repo-mirror --help
    Usage: repo-mirror [options] -- REPO_COMMAND...
    
    run repo commands with transparent local git mirrors management.
    
    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -m MIRROR_DIR, --mirror-dir=MIRROR_DIR
                            repo mirror dir, mandatory (for instance: -m $HOME
                            /.repo-mirror)
      -j JOBS, --jobs=JOBS  repo mirror sync jobs, passed to repo sync when
                            fetching mirrors
      -r REPO, --repo=REPO  repo tool actual executable. Default: repo (as found
                            in $PATH)
      ...


# Build and Install

This tool requires python 2.6.x, 2.7.x or >= 3.x.

The tool can be used directly without installation by executing
directly repo-mirror where downloaded.

A makefile is provided anyway for completion and testing purpose.

Build with:

    $ make all # a no-op actually

Run unit tests with:

    $ make -j8 check

Install with, for instance:

    $ make install PREFIX=$HOME/local  # Default is PREFIX=/usr/local
